# Enhanced NLP Model

Created by [bufferwise](https://bento.me/buffer)

A state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing model implementation using PyTorch, featuring advanced transformer architecture with performance optimizations and professional-grade training capabilities.

## Features

The Enhanced NLP Model, developed by bufferwise, provides a robust foundation for natural language processing tasks with the following key features:

- Transformer-based architecture with multi-head attention
- Mixed precision training for improved performance
- Gradient accumulation for handling larger batch sizes
- Dynamic learning rate scheduling with warmup
- Label smoothing for better generalization
- Advanced weight initialization techniques
- Comprehensive logging system
- Type hints and extensive documentation
- Modular architecture with configuration management
- GELU activation functions
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install torch numpy typing dataclasses logging
```

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example to get you started:

```python
from enhanced_nlp_model import create_model, ModelConfig
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Initialize model with default configuration
vocab_size = 30000  # Set based on your tokenizer
model, trainer = create_model(vocab_size)

# Prepare your dataset
train_dataset = TextDataset(texts, tokenizer, max_length=512)
train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Train the model
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    loss = trainer.train_epoch(train_dataloader)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss}")
```

## Architecture

The model consists of several key components:

1. **Embedding Layer**: Converts token IDs to dense vectors
2. **Positional Encoding**: Adds position information to embeddings
3. **Transformer Blocks**: Multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks
4. **Output Layer**: Projects to vocabulary size for token prediction

### Model Configuration

You can customize the model architecture using the ModelConfig class:

```python
config = ModelConfig(
    vocab_size=30000,
    d_model=512,
    num_heads=8,
    num_layers=6,
    d_ff=2048,
    dropout=0.1,
    max_seq_length=5000,
    learning_rate=1e-4,
    warmup_steps=4000,
    label_smoothing=0.1
)
```

## Training

The EnhancedTrainer class provides sophisticated training capabilities:

- **Mixed Precision Training**: Automatically handles FP16/FP32 conversion
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Enables training with larger effective batch sizes
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Implements warm-up and decay strategies
- **Logging**: Comprehensive training progress monitoring

Example training configuration:

```python
# Create trainer with custom configuration
trainer = EnhancedTrainer(model, config)

# Train with gradient accumulation
loss = trainer.train_epoch(dataloader, accumulation_steps=4)
```

## Model Saving and Loading

Save your trained model:

```python
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'enhanced_nlp_model.pth')
```

Load a saved model:

```python
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('enhanced_nlp_model.pth'))
```

## Inference

Perform inference with your trained model:

```python
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt')
    output = model(input_ids)
    predictions = output.argmax(dim=-1)
```

## Performance Optimization

The model includes several optimizations for improved training performance:

- Batch processing with efficient memory management
- Mixed precision training using PyTorch's autocast
- Gradient accumulation for handling larger batch sizes
- Learning rate scheduling with warmup period
- Weight initialization for better convergence
